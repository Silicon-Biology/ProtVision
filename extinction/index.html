        <h3>THIS TOOL WILL GIVE YOU THE EXTINCTION COEFFICIENT AND ABSORBANCE OF THE PROTEIN SEQUENCE YOU PROVIDE</h3> <br>
    <h4> <u> NOTE</u>: <br> As you can see this tool can take inputs from the user in three different ways: 1. by giving the sequence directly as input, 2. by giving the Uniprot ID of the target sequence or 3. by giving a file which has the target sequence. <br>
        There are certain rules to follow while using any of these methods. They are:
        <ul>
            <li> If you are entering the sequence directly please make sure that the greater than symbol <b> (>) </b> is present in the begining of the sequence. And there's no meta-information present. Also all the lettters in the sequence should be in Capital/Block letters. If the ">" is not present it will be considered as an Accession ID and searched for inn UniProt, resulting in an error.</li>
            <li> If you are entering the accession ID please enter only the UNIPROT accesssion id. The accession id of other databases should not be used. </li>
            <li> For file input, please make sure that the symbol ">" is not present in the beginning of the sequence and there's only one sequence in the file.</li>
        </ul>
